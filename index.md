# Hello World

Hey there! My name is Braxton Lee, and I’m a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/). I’m studying Computer Science, and this is my little corner on the web.

## Computer Science Projects

Here are a few of my favorite projects from CPSC 120:

### Lab 7: Interactive Parking Signs

Lab 7 was one of my favorites because it was so much more interactive than some of the other assignments. We worked on figuring out how parking signs work and then coding that logic into a program. It was fun to see how real-world rules like parking times can be turned into something a computer can understand. I liked how hands-on it felt, and it made me realize how coding can solve everyday problems. Plus, it felt cool when everything finally worked the way it should.

### Lab 11: State Names and Population Density

Lab 11 was super interesting because we got to work with real data about states and their population densities. It was kind of fun to find out which states have the highest and lowest densities while working with code. I liked how it combined programming with stuff you could actually use in real life. I also learned a lot about organizing and working with data, which felt like an important skill to have. This lab made me feel like I was doing something both useful and educational.

### Lab 8: Triangle Patterns with Loops  
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2024/cpsc-120-lab-08-reyli-derek.git)

Lab 8 was a fun one because we got to mess around with loops to make triangle patterns using dashes and pipes. It was pretty cool to see how just a few lines of code could create something that looked so organized and patterned. This lab helped me understand how nested loops work, and it really improved my logic skills. It was satisfying to see the triangles appear on the screen exactly how I wanted them to. It was one of those moments where coding felt less like work and more like creating something cool.
